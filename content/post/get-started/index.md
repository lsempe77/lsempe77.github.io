Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This blog is a space to share my work and insights in impact evaluation, evidence synthesis, and research on education, social protection, and health policy. I am passionate about advancing mental health for youth and leveraging large language models (LLMs) in research and practical applications. Here, youâ€™ll find updates on my projects, publications, and reflections on international development and policy.

Feel free to explore, connect, and reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaboration or learning more about my research!
