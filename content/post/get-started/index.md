Welcome 👋

This blog is a space to share my work and insights in impact evaluation, evidence synthesis, and research on education, social protection, and health policy. I am passionate about advancing mental health for youth and leveraging large language models (LLMs) in research and practical applications. Here, you’ll find updates on my projects, publications, and reflections on international development and policy.

Feel free to explore, connect, and reach out if you’re interested in collaboration or learning more about my research!
