## About Me

I am a Senior Evaluation Specialist at the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) and a Research Fellow at Queen Margaret University. My work focuses on impact evaluation, evidence synthesis, and health systems in international development. I have led research projects on artificial intelligence in agriculture, health financing, and education policy, and collaborate with academic and policy institutions to improve evidence use in low- and middle-income countries.
