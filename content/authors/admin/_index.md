## About Me

I am a Senior Evaluation Specialist at 3ie and Research Fellow at Queen Margaret University. Before transitioning to research, I spent over a decade in Peru's civil service, where I managed £2 billion in education budgets, led results-based budgeting reforms for the Ministry of Education, and served as political representative to regional governments. I oversaw teacher training programs, school governance systems, and the construction of 215 community centres (Tambos) serving indigenous populations in remote areas.

This public sector experience shapes my research on impact evaluation, evidence synthesis, and policy implementation. My work spans education policy, health systems financing, and social protection across Latin America, Africa, and fragile settings. I combine rigorous methods with practical understanding of how evidence translates into government action.
