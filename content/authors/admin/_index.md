    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Senior Evaluation Specialist at the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) and a Research Fellow at Queen Margaret University. My work focuses on impact evaluation, evidence synthesis, and health systems in international development. I have led research projects on artificial intelligence in agriculture, health financing, and education policy, and collaborate with academic and policy institutions to improve evidence use in low- and middle-income countries.
