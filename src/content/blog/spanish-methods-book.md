title: "Writing a Methods Book Nobody Asked For"
summary: "Most research methodology textbooks are written by people who've forgotten what it's like not to know things. I wrote one in Spanish for the student I used to be—disorganized, confused, and making the same mistakes repeatedly."

I entered academia late. I'd studied many things, worked in various fields, accumulated knowledge in a disorganized way that left gaps where fundamentals should be. When I finally started doing research seriously, I realized how much time I'd wasted—not from lack of effort, but from lack of guidance.

The methodology textbooks didn't help. They were written by experts who'd forgotten what confusion feels like. They presented research as a clean, linear process: formulate hypothesis, design study, collect data, analyze, conclude. Real research isn't like that. Real research is messy, iterative, full of wrong turns and recovered mistakes.

So I started writing something different. Not for the student who knows everything, but for myself—to remember what I did wrong and what, occasionally, I got right.

## The Problem with Methods Textbooks

Standard methodology textbooks have a pedagogical structure that makes sense to professors: start with epistemology, move to research design, then data collection, then analysis. Each chapter assumes you've mastered the previous one.

But students don't learn that way. They're usually trying to write a thesis while taking the methods course. They need practical guidance now, not philosophical grounding for later. They want to know: how do I write a research question? What makes a good hypothesis? Why does my advisor keep rejecting my drafts?

The books don't answer those questions directly. They explain what a hypothesis *is* without explaining how to write one that won't embarrass you. They describe sampling strategies without mentioning that your actual sample will be whoever agrees to participate.

## A Different Approach

The book I'm writing—slowly, chapter by chapter, as I teach—tries to be honest about research practice. It's in Spanish because that's what my students need, and because good methods resources in Spanish are surprisingly scarce.

Each chapter starts with problems, not theory. What goes wrong? What mistakes do people make? Then we work backward to principles that prevent those mistakes.

For example, instead of defining "operationalization" abstractly, I show thesis drafts where the research question asks one thing and the survey measures something else entirely. The gap is obvious once you see it. Then we discuss how to avoid that gap.

The book is built in Bookdown, which means it's a living document. I can update chapters as I teach, add examples from current students' work, and make corrections when I realize I was wrong about something.

## Politically Incorrect

The subtitle mentions being "politically incorrect," which sounds provocative but really just means: I say things methods textbooks usually don't.

For instance: qualitative and quantitative research aren't equal for all purposes. If you want to know whether a drug works, you run a randomized trial, not an ethnography. If you want to understand why patients don't take their medication, qualitative methods might serve better. Pretending these approaches are interchangeable isn't pluralism—it's confusion.

I also discuss how academic incentives shape research practice in ways that aren't always acknowledged. Why do papers hedge their conclusions? Why are null results rare in journals? Why do literature reviews cite the same twenty papers? These are practical realities students will encounter, and pretending they don't exist doesn't prepare anyone for actual academic work.

## What I've Learned

Writing the book has taught me how little I actually understood about things I thought I knew. Explaining something clearly requires understanding it deeply, and my explanations keep revealing gaps.

The students teach me too. Their questions identify where my explanations fail. Their mistakes show me which concepts need more emphasis. Their thesis drafts demonstrate what's actually confusing versus what I assumed would be confusing.

The book remains incomplete. Chapters exist in various states of polish. Some are taught every semester and refined accordingly. Others are outlines waiting for time I don't have. But the partial version is already useful—students access it online, suggest corrections, and occasionally cite it in their own work.

## A Note on Language

Writing in Spanish matters. Most methodology resources come from English-speaking academia, and translation isn't just about words. Research cultures differ. Thesis expectations differ. The path from student to researcher differs.

A Spanish-language methods book can address the Latin American academic context directly: the specific challenges of doing research with limited funding, the relationship between universities and government, the tension between local relevance and international publication. These aren't footnotes—they're central to how research actually happens in the region.
